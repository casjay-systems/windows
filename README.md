# [Jason's DotFiles](https://github.com/casjay)  
  
These are the base dotfiles that I start with when I set up a  
new environment. For more specific local needs I use the `.local`  
    
## Install  
  
Open powershell with admin privileges and execute the following command:  
```shell
iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/casjay-systems/windows/master/install.cmd'))
```
